FractionCalculator -
	A simple post-fix style fraction calculator, written in assembly 
	for CSC-250.

===_FEATURES=========================================================
	-Adds, Subtracts, Divides, and finds the square-root of fractions
	-Can convert a fraction to a real, and back to a fraction.
	-Also adds/subtracts/multiplies/divides real numbers.
____NOTES/BUGS_______________________________________________________
	1)	Square-Root - When finding the square root of a real number,
		the calculator will at first display an absurd number.  Switch
		back to fraction-mode to see the acurate representation.
	2)	Switching back and forth between fraction and real mode when
		  displaying numbers with many trailing decimals can cause
		  accuracy problems in the real and fraction representation.
		  *	switching back and forth again will then fix this problem
____BUILDING__________________________________________________________
	>>	To build this project, I've included a batch file in the root 
		  directory that automates the process.  If you'd like to 
		  build by hand, feel free.
____FILE/DIR INFO______________________________________________________
	>>	All source files are located in the src directory, and the
		  resource files are in the resource directory.
	>>	Object files created by the assembler are left in the /obj 
		  directory.
	>>	All directories marked _ignore contain unused, or old files.  
		  They are included for reference, or for future/past features
